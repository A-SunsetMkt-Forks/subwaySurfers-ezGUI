### Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

### Credits

- A **MASSIVE** thanks to [@moddedmcplayer](https://github.com/moddedmcplayer) for finding the decryption key, I simply added a web version to it.
- Project leader: [@Noobgamer0111](https://github.com/Noobgamer0111)
- Component library: DaisyUI

### Note

The UI for now is not one of the best, so If someone has some ideas it is possible to join the discord server: https://discord.gg/nghc84wjSZ
